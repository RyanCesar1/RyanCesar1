## About Me

I am a Computer Science and Economics student at Case Western Reserve University. I am currenlty a sophomore studying Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Computer Organization. I have experience in object-oriented programming and basic machine learning using python. I am interested in full-stack web development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. If you are interested in collaborating on a project in these areas or others, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I will be beginning my research endeavors as a writer and researcher for the CWRU Journal of Economics at the Weatherhead School of Management this Spring.
